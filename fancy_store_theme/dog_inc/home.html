							<b class="title">DCist: First Look: Dog Tag Bakery</b>
							<span class="date">Date: January 21, 20115</span>
							<div class="description">
								<p>Georgetown’s newest bakery is a comfortable place to get your fix of baked goods and caffeine while supporting a good cause.
								</p><p>Tucked away on a quiet street off Wisconsin Avenue, the nonprofit Dog Tag Bakery (3206 Grace Street NW) is a work-study program designed to help military veterans looking to re-enter the workforce. Recruits of the six-month program work at the bakery and take business classes at Georgetown University. During the process, they learn about all aspects of running a business, from accounting to store design to organizing trash collection.
								</p><p>Head baker Rebecca Clerget oversees the daily menu, which includes breakfast pastries, sweets and lunch sandwiches. Customer favorites include the ham and cheddar scone, brownies, and the turkey, brie and cranberry sandwich. In a break from trend, you won’t find any cupcakes here. Try a chocolate or lemon financier instead.
								</p><p>Dog Tag also serves coffee and espresso by Compass Coffee—a D.C. business started by former U.S. Marines.
								</p><p>Since opening in early December, the shop has consistently expanded its operation. Hours have been significantly increased to cater to the after-work crowd and lingering customers. And new products are being planned, including homemade croissants and special order items. Clerget also hopes to soon add a second daily bake to allow people to grab fresh goods through the evening.
								</p><p>In addition to buying products from the bakery, you can also shop for food and merchandise on theonline store.
								</p><p>Dog Tag Bakery is located at 3206 Grace Street NW and is open Wednesday through Sunday.

							<b class="title">CBS News: Wounded veterans find recipe for their futures at Dog Tag Bakery</b>
							<span class="date">Date: January 17, 20115</span>
							<div class="description">
								<p>Welcome to Dog Tag Bakery, now open in Washington, D.C., after eight years of planning and prayer. "I never gave up because I knew that this was a good work," founder Rick Curry said.
								</p><p>Curry had the "prayer" part covered. As for other, secular resources, this Jesuit priest partnered up with a real estate mogul named Connie Milstein.
								</p><p>"He is the Jesuit father, and I am the Jewish godmother," Milstein said at the bakery's opening ceremony.
								</p><p>Both wanted to help disabled veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan ease into the next chapter of their lives. They opened Dog Tag to make sure the vets would have marketable skills.
								</p><p>"I was trained as a baker as a very young Jesuit, and I thought, 'I'm going to teach them how to bake,'" Curry recalls.
								</p><p>Here, the fellows, as they're called, learn not just how to bake but also how to run the business of a bakery. Veterans like retired Army Ranger Sedrick Banks, whose neck was broken in a mortar attack in Iraq.
								</p><p>"Dog Tag was my first major step back into the working mindset," Banks said. "Before the program, I didn't have confidence. I didn't feel like I had the ability. Now I'm confident in myself, you know?"
								</p><p>"The world thinks that disabled veterans can't be hired. And that's absolutely absurd," Curry said. "And we're here to prove them wrong."
								</p><p>Father Rick knows a little something about proving people wrong: He was born with just one arm.
								</p><p>"I believe that disability is a gift," Curry said. "It's very hard. It's very difficult. It can be difficult to accept but in the long run to accept your disability as a gift is positive."
								</p><p>Sgt. Banks rediscovered his identify here, which is what makes the name of this place so fitting -- identity, after all, being the purpose of a dog tag. It's just one of the many things Father Rick has baked into his program.
								</p><p>"I want our fellows here to be happy," Curry said. "I want them to be successful, but I also want them to be happy."
								</p><p>The program to teach the vets the small business skills they'd need to run a bakery is done in partnership with Georgetown University.
